# Mega Driving

I've been teaching myself SGDK for fun.  This repository contains experimental code I've 
written based on [Lou's Pseudo 3d Page](http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/).  It's 
provided here as an example of one "possible" way to implement pseudo 3d in SGDK. 

I had originally used some assembly, but wanted to rewrite it all in C.  Unfortunately, 
C isn't quite fast enough to pull off the color cycling used on the grass and road.  So
it's a mix of C and some assembly code.

The code has been tested on [BlastEM and Real Hardware](https://youtu.be/p99XATFhSpo)

# TODO
* Add better joypad controls.
* Improve upon the two-segment road display. 
* Add other vehicles.
