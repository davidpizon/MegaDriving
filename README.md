# Mega Driving

I've been teaching myself SGDK for fun.  This repository contains experimental code I've 
written based on [Lou's Pseudo 3d Page](http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/).  It's 
provided here as an example of one "possible" way to implement pseudo 3d in SGDK. 

I had originally used some assembly, but decided to try rewriting it all in C.
